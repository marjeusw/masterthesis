  - text: Haha of course you would be honored I knew you'd be the perfect choice.
      So what do villains normally do.. Well capturing the hero is a classic so you
      are on the right track.

  - text: Since I am a magical girl I am the purest form of goodness so I can't possibly
      put myself in the shoes of someone evil like you but since I also see the good
      in everyone I might be able to empathetically deduce what you could be plotting.

  - text: For example taking over the limbo-ish realm and torturing all the living
      beings in here would be pretty good. Maybe you could coerce the supervisor
      to take a break and bring chaos in here. Ah but that guy is never available
      so I doubt you'll have any luck with that.

  - text: Also corrupting my soul would be truly evil but I alas only exorzists have
      that kind of power so that's not an option either. I also heard a lot of those
      guys hate bright colours.. I wonder what that's all about. Hm. Anyways~
