//TINY BIT OF HELP FROM CHATGPT HERE (I can into an infinite loop at the end of the script that I fixed with its help)
//Script that handles all the dialogue in the end for the objects the user found
//I decided to make the user poke the soul object each time for a new line to make it not as boring to just sit and wait while the witch is talking but I may change that at a later date
//Its basically a lot of if else statements that all go to a coroutine in which the hands are grayed out to show the user can't interact while the soul is talking
//it culminates with the soul walking out
